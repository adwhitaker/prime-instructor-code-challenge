# Prime Instructor Code Challenge

Welcome!

This application challenge is intended to give you a chance to demonstrate your technical skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a similar challenge given to students early on in the program so as such, it is intentionally simplified and not expected to be a production-ready application. 

Unit tests and authentication are certainly great, but not here. Please focus on the functional components and providing solid code **you could use to teach beginning programmers.**


## Do

- Follow the instructions below
- Demonstrate what you feel to be best practices in terms of code style and organization
- Consider the usability of your application
- Use CSS libraries/frameworks as you like (CSS only!)
- Have Fun!


## Do Not

- Invent features
- Use any JavaScript frameworks or libraries
- Include any build tools, unit tests, or authentication layer


## The Client Side Salary Calculator

Create an application that manages employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. This is to be a client-side only application - no server or database.

### Functional Requirements

The application needs to be able to gather the information (see wireframe), store it, and display it back on the DOM. The user needs to get a total summary of the MONTHLY salary cost. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, notify the user in some way.

Users need to be able to delete each entry and the monthly calculation needs to reflect it.
